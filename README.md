# Daily_Planner

## Description

This planner allows you to save a list of items in specific timeslots! These timeslots are updated hourly and when the next hour begins all items move up the list. Past items are uneditable and saves on those items are disabled. These items are saved in the localStorage and match the corrosponding hour with the key that is named for the hour that it was saved on. When these match the item is placed on the timeslot!
